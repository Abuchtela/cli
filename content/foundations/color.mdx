Terminals reliably recognize the 8 basic ANSI colors. There are also bright versions of each of these colors that you can use, but less reliably.

### Things to note
- Background color is available but we haven’t taken advantage of it yet.
- Some terminals do not reliably support 256-color escape sequences.
- Users can customize how their terminal displays the 8 basic colors, but that’s opt-in (for example, the user knows they’re making their greens not green).
- Only use color to [enhance meaning](https://primer.style/design/accessibility/guidelines#use-of-color), not to communicate meaning.
