When designing for GitHub CLI, there are several ways you can go about prototyping your ideas.

## Google Docs

Best for simple quick illustrations of most ideas

Use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JIRErIUuJ6fTgabiFYfCH3x91pyHuytbfa0QLnTfXKM/edit?usp=sharing), or format your document with these steps:
1. Choose a dark background (File > Page Setup > Page Color)
1. Choose a light text color
1. Choose a monospace font

**Tips**
- Mix it up since peopleâ€™s setups change so much. Not everyone uses dark background!
- Make use of the document outline and headers to help communicate your ideas

## Figma

If you need to show a process unfolding over time, or need to show a prototype that feels more real to users, Figma or code prototypes are best.
